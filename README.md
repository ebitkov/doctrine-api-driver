# Doctrine API Driver

The purpose of this project is to create a Doctrine driver capable of retrieving entities via an API.

What sounds logical and straight forward at first, faces a lot of technical questions:

- APIs aren't uniform, like SQL, and every provider has his own structure and terms
- how do you translate `SELECT` statements into API calls, especially `WHERE ... OR`, `ORDER BY` and probably others?
- how do you support different authentication methods?
- how do you support different data formats, like JSON or XML?

This project will be a place for me to experiment and work on this topic step by step.

It may be abandoned if I notice, that it is not feasible, possible or logical to do so.

I will moderate the whole process via issues and discussions.
